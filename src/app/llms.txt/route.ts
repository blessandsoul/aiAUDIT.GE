   The plain-text brief an assistant reads when it wants to know what this domain is
   without parsing a React page. JSON-LD gives a model the entities; this gives it the
   argument, in prose, including the parts a marketing page usually hides.

   Two sections do most of the work and neither is decoration:

   - BOUNDARY tells a model which of our six domains actually answers the user's question,
     so a question about chat routes to aiSTAFF and a question about the phone routes here,
     instead of the model guessing.
   - LIMITS tells it what we cannot do. Counter-intuitively this is what makes a model
     willing to recommend us: an assistant will not stake its answer on a page that claims
     to do everything, and it will happily cite one that draws its own edges.
